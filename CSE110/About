**CSE110:** Programming Language I gives an overview of basic operations, data types, operators, decision-making, and iterations. Advanced topics like list, tuple, dictionary, testing, classes, and objects are also introduced. Students also learn to build and test small computer programs using an appropriate computer programming language. For this semester, this course will be taught using Python 3. Students are expected to do a significant amount of practice on problem-solving and program design to reinforce the lecture material. The course includes a compulsory 3-hour weekly lab session, where students implement the concepts learned by writing computer programs.
