# N-gram Tutorial: In-depth Intuition in NLP

This repository contains resources and insights from the N-gram tutorial by Krish Naik, focused on providing an in-depth understanding of N-grams in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The tutorial is presented in Hindi and covers various aspects of N-grams, including their significance, applications, and implementation.

## Overview

N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (words, characters, etc.) from a given text or speech. They are a fundamental concept in NLP and are widely used in language modeling, text classification, and other applications.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Definition of N-grams**: Understanding what N-grams are and how they are formed.
- **Types of N-grams**: 
  - Unigrams (1-grams)
  - Bigrams (2-grams)
  - Trigrams (3-grams)
  - Higher-order N-grams
- **Applications**: How N-grams are used in various NLP tasks, such as text prediction, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
- **Implementation**: Practical examples of how to implement N-grams in Python.

## Usage

To create N-grams from a given text, you can follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the text (tokenization, lowercasing, etc.).
2. Choose the value of n for the N-gram (e.g., 1 for unigrams, 2 for bigrams).
3. Generate the N-grams from the tokenized text.

### Example Code

Here's a simple example of how to generate N-grams in Python:

```python
from nltk import ngrams
from collections import Counter

def generate_ngrams(text, n):
    tokens = text.split()  # Basic tokenization
    n_grams = ngrams(tokens, n)
    return Counter(n_grams)

# Example usage
text = "I love natural language processing"
bigrams = generate_ngrams(text, 2)
print(bigrams)
```

# Laplace Smoothing in NLP

Laplace smoothing, also known as additive smoothing, is a technique used in statistics and machine learning to address zero-frequency problems in categorical data. It ensures that events that have not been observed in the training data are assigned a non-zero probability, thereby preventing the assignment of zero probabilities to unseen events.

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Laplace smoothing is particularly useful when dealing with language models, especially Naive Bayes classifiers. By applying this technique, we can improve the model's performance on unseen data and avoid issues related to overfitting.

## Key Concepts

- **Zero-Frequency Problem**: This occurs when an event (e.g., a word) does not appear in the training dataset, leading to a probability of zero for that event.
- **Additive Smoothing**: By adding a small constant (usually 1) to the counts of each event, we can ensure that no event has a zero probability.

## Usage

To implement Laplace smoothing in your NLP projects, consider the following steps:

1. Calculate the frequency of each event in your training data.
2. Apply Laplace smoothing by adding 1 (or a small constant) to each frequency count.
3. Normalize the counts to obtain probabilities.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to apply Laplace smoothing in Python:

```python
def laplace_smoothing(counts, vocab_size):
    smoothed_counts = {word: count + 1 for word, count in counts.items()}
    total_counts = sum(smoothed_counts.values())
    return {word: count / total_counts for word, count in smoothed_counts.items()}

# Example usage
counts = {'word1': 5, 'word2': 0, 'word3': 3}
vocab_size = len(counts)
smoothed_probs = laplace_smoothing(counts, vocab_size)
print(smoothed_probs)
