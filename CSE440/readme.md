â€‹Laplace smoothing, also known as additive smoothing, is a technique used in statistics and machine learning to handle zero-frequency problems in categorical data. It assigns a non-zero probability to events that have not been observed in the training data, thereby preventing the assignment of zero probabilities to unseen events.
